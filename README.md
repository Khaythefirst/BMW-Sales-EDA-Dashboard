## Project Overview
BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke), also known as Bavarian Motor Works, is a German multinational luxury vehicle and motorcycle manufacturer headquartered in Munich. 
 
The company is well-known for its premium and luxury vehicles, as well as high-performance BMW M and BMW Motorrad motorcycles. 
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and dashboard creation using BMW sales data obtained from Kaggle in order to uncover critical insights that will help BMW improve its sales performance.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales & Revenue Trends Over Years**: An analysis of how BMW's total sales/revenue changes over time (year by year), which helps determine overall growth or decline.
- **Model & Fuel type performance**: An evaluation of how various BMW models contribute to total sales and revenue.
- **Regional Sales Performance**: A comparative analysis of BMW's performance in different regions.
- **Revenue Contribution by Model and Region**: A review of which models perform best in which regions. These include regional preferences for specific models, as well as strategic product placement opportunities.

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings

With a notable peak in 2022, BMW's sales have grown significantly across seven regions between 2010 and 2024. Analysis by model and fuel type reveals that certain models consistently outsell others, with hybrid vehicles dominating most regions and petrol vehicles showing emerging growth trends. Though certain models can be held largely responsible for this increase, the following sections will address additional contributing factors and highlight important areas for improvement.

Below is the overview page from the Power BI dashboard and more examples are included throughout the report. The entire interactive dashboard can be downloaded here.


### Sales & Revenue Trends:

- BMWâ€™s performance between 2010 and 2024 shows clear highs and lows. In 2022, the company hit its peak, generating $1.34 trillion in revenue with 17.9 million units sold, marking the strongest year in the period under review.
- However, there were setbacks along the way. Both 2020 and 2023 saw significant drops, with 2023 being the weakest year, recording just $1.22 trillion in revenue and 16.2 million sales.
- Despite these downturns, the brand showed resilience. A slight recovery in 2021 paved the way for a peak 2022, and following a dramatic drop in 2023, sales and revenue rebounded strongly in 2024.
- Overall, the year-over-year trends show a cyclical pattern of decline and recovery, but one that consistently demonstrates BMW's strong market presence and ability to rebound.

### Model & Fuel type performance:

- BMW 7 series is the best selling model, contributing a total of $1.79 trillion to the total revenue and 23.79 million unit sold across all regions.
