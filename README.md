BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke), also known as Bavarian Motor Works, is a German multinational luxury vehicle and motorcycle manufacturer headquartered in Munich. 
 
The company is well-known for its premium and luxury vehicles, as well as high-performance BMW M and BMW Motorrad motorcycles. 
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and dashboard creation using BMW sales data obtained from Kaggle in order to uncover critical insights that will help BMW improve its sales performance.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Revenue Trends Over Years**: An analysis of how BMW's total revenue changes over time (year by year), which helps determine overall sales growth or decline.

- **Regional Sales Performance**: A comparative analysis of BMW's performance in different regions.
- **Revenue Contribution by Model and Region**: A review of which models perform best in which regions. These include regional preferences for specific models, as well as strategic product placement opportunities.
